Ninja Trials Resurrection
=========================

This project is a fork of Ninja Trials and it's aimed to complete at least a simplified version of the game.

I've had to cut the original project to make this viable:
 * No intro/outro/story/credits/... animated sequences.
 * No special transitions.
 * Includes the first 4 of 8 trials.
 * Includes 42 of the 130+ sounds and 10 of 20 music tracks.
 * Windows, Linux and OS X compatible (no Android, HTML5 or iOS support).
 * Two action buttons instead of four.
 * Keyboard and usb game controller only. No mouse or touch interface.
 * No how-to-play screen.
 * No character profiles.
 * No afk loops.
 * No extras menu.
 * No Steam integration.

How to import the project into Eclipse
--------------------------------------

1. Install Gradle extensions for Eclipse.
2. File -> Import -> Gradle project
3. If you see any error at the end of the import process you might ignore it, the build will work anyway.
4. Go to ninja-trials-core -> properties -> Java build path -> Libraries -> Add JARs -> select ninja-trials-core/tablelayout.jar

Seeking collaboration
---------------------

We are looking for a graphic designer who wants to join this open source project and who could create arts that are consistent with the prior PigSaint's work and licensed under Creative Commons. If you are interested please contact to bralmu@gmail.com

Project history
---------------

Ninja Trials started on 2013 as a hobby by [Mad Gear Games](http://madgeargames.com), a diverse group of friends:

 * Bralmu (software developer)
 * Danpelgar (software developer, sound producer and music composer, scrum master)
 * JJHagar (project leader, game designer, a little of everything)
 * PigSaint (lead graphic designer)
 * Virako (software developer)
 * Wargo (software developer)

The project was halt, semi-finished on April 2015 with a playable demo shown at the GamerCon of the Sal√≥n Manga de Jerez. On May 2015 Mad Gear Games was established as a Private Limited Company by three members (now shareholders) who focused all efforts on a second project called [A Hole New World](http://madgeargames.com/ahnw/).

The original Ninja Trials project is held under a private [repository](https://bitbucket.org/virako/ninjatrials) on Bitbucket to avoid spoilers and leaks.
